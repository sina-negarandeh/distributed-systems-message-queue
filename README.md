One way to connect processes is the queue method. Message queues are usually provided by the operating system and are used to communicate between clients and servers. Message Broker enqueues messages sent from a sender in a queue. If the recipient is ready to receive, the Broker delivers the messages to the recipient in the order of the queue.
